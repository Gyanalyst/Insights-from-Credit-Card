# Providing Insights For Credit Card Launch To Mitron Bank

# About the Company & Problem Statement

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.
Now my role as a data analyst is to provide report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank.

The Findings will include:
Demographic Insights
Income Utilization Insights & weâ€™ll study about their Spending habits.

# Solution

Iâ€™ve analyzed the pilot data of 4000 customers' demographic and spending patterns to find their key clients, their top preferred categories, and when they spend the most. This helps Mitron Bankâ€™s strategy team develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
These findings and insights were provided with a user-friendly Power BI report.

# Process

After studying the provided dataset and other insights, I conducted background research on recent credit trends. This helped in forming accurate recommendations. I began by crafting necessary queries to identify essential KPIs, prioritize insights, and develop a user-friendly visualization report.
Data Importing and Preparation
I imported CSV data into Power Query in Power BI, creating calculated columns and DAX measures for crucial KPIs. This includes averages like income utilization %, monthly spend, and spend per transaction, crucial for decision-making on offering strategies, annual fees, and joining fee structures.

# Dashboard Design and Visualization

The dashboard design starts with choosing visuals for each metric, followed by selecting the color palette and layout style. Then, I arrange visuals and adjust page navigation across all report pages. In this simple version, you can see how the I approach solves the user needs.

# Recommendations

â€¢ Key clients fall within the age range of 25-45.

â€¢ Gender and marital status do not significantly impact key clients, as top preferred spending categories remain consistent.

â€¢ Salaried employees and freelancers are key clients.

â€¢ Key client locations: Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru.

â€¢ Delhi is a significant market; focus on increasing the client base in this region.

â€¢ Festive months (August, September, October) show high spending and income utilization percentages.

â€¢ Top preferred spending categories: Bills, Groceries, Electronics, Health and Wellness, and Travel.

# What I Learned ðŸŒ±

While working on this project, I learned how customer income utilization patterns aid in identifying reliable key clients for financial products. I created a user-friendly report, gaining insights into a strategic visual placement that impacts stakeholder decision-makingâ€”a firsthand lesson in effective dashboard design.
